# Real-Time-Collaborative-Editor
Real-time collaborative editors are fascinating examples of distributed systems in action, constantly balancing immediate feedback with eventual consistency.


Real-time collaborative editors, like Google Docs or Figma, allow multiple users to work on the same document or design simultaneously, seeing each other's changes instantly



Frontend (e.g., React, Vue, Angular): For the user interface.

Text Editor Component: A simple <textarea> for basic text, or a more advanced library like CodeMirror, Monaco Editor (from VS Code), or Tiptap/ProseMirror for rich text/code.

Backend (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, Go): To manage WebSocket connections and orchestrate communication.

WebSocket Library (e.g., Socket.IO for Node.js): To handle real-time communication between clients and the server.

Synchronization Logic: This is where you'd implement a simplified version of OT or CRDT, or use a library like Y.js, to ensure all clients' document states remain consistent. For a very basic example, the server might simply broadcast every character change to all connected clients, but this quickly becomes problematic with concurrent edits.
